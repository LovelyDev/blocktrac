# Zitui - Zerp Tracker Frontend Web UI

## Overview
Zitui is the implementation of the Zerp Tracker frontend, a service used to register and run JSONPath filters against XRP blockchain transactions.

Zitui requires a Ziti backend be deployed and is accessible for web API requests. Zitui handles user interface interaction and dispatches calls to the Ziti web API.

Zitui is implemented as a [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) static site and imposes minimal requirements beyond a standard vuejs stack.

Zitui was developed on *Fedora Linux* systems and deployed to a *CentOS* environment though theoretically an environment which supports vuejs should suffice to run the application.
